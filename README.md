# Project Overview

This project is built using React, configured with Webpack for module bundling. To streamline development, especially as I'm currently not any experinced in TypeScript, I opted to integrate Bootstrap. This choice allows me to focus on functionality and design without the steep learning curve of TypeScript for now.

Key Features:
    Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
